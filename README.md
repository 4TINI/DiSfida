# DiSfida (http://www.peopleatdeib.polimi.it/)

DiSfida is a competition promoted by the department of electronics and Bioengineering of Politecnico di Milano to develop solutions proposed by three NPO:
- UILDM Onlus (https://www.uildm.org/storia-e-mission)
- Debra	Italia	Onlus (http://www.debraitalia.com/)
- FoRCardio Onlus (http://www.forcardio.it/)

In particular the last NPO listed is the one I realized the project for. The goal was to create a game or a demonstrative device to teach kids from 6 to 10 years old how the cardiovascular system works. 

We realized a prototype of the game the kids could physically interface together with an android app which would lead them through different levels and educational hints about the cardiovascular system. In the Repository there's a copy of the presentation we held at the end of the project.
