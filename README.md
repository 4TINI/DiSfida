# DiSfida (http://www.peopleatdeib.polimi.it/)
DiSfida is a competition promoted by the department of electronics and Bioengineering of Politecnico di Milano to develop solutions proposed by three NPO:
- UILDM Onlus (https://www.uildm.org/storia-e-mission)
- Debra	Italia	Onlus (http://www.debraitalia.com/)
- FoRCardio Onlus (http://www.forcardio.it/)

In particular the last NPO listed is the one I realized the project for. The goal was to create a game or a demonstrative device to teach kids from 6 to 10 years old how the cardiovascular system works.
